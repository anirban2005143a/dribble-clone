      I designed a Helpdesk product during my time as design director at 
      <span class="border-b-2 border-[#ea64d9] pb-1">Capacity</span>.
    </p>

    <p class="text-[20px] leading-relaxed text-gray-900 mb-10">
      Helpdesk is a core part of the Capacity platform because support issues
      that cannot be resolved with automation must be escalated to a [human]
      agent. We spent a lot of effort building personas around the helpdesk
      agents so we could understand their needs.
    </p>

    <p class="text-[20px] leading-relaxed text-gray-900">
      This wasn't a time-boxed project with a clear end date. Rather, this was
      work that evolved over time as we released an MVP to the market,
      observed how customers used it, and adjusted and iterated over time. The
      following shows, not all, but many of the features we designed and
      shipped to the delight of our customers.

   <p class="text-[20px] leading-relaxed text-gray-900 mb-10">
    Helpdesk agents can add new Q&amp;A to a knowledge base without leaving the helpdesk. The <span class="font-semibold">inquiry</span> and <span class="font-semibold">response</span> cards are the same component used in the <span class="border-b-2 border-[#ea64d9] pb-1">knowledge base</span>.
  </p>

export const textHtml3 = `
  <p class="text-[20px] leading-relaxed text-gray-900 mb-10">
  <strong>Helpdesk Message Composer UI</strong> – This part of the UI is a great example of when
  you need to pack a ton of important functionality in a relatively small space—all
  while making it look clean and enjoyable to use.
</p>

<p class="text-[20px] leading-relaxed text-gray-900">
  Voice of Customer and competitor analysis made it clear that we were going to
  need to support <strong>public</strong> and <strong>private</strong> messages. There were concerns about mixing
  public and private messages in the same space because it may be hard to orient
  yourself in the conversation. I opted to use the <strong>tab</strong> component to bifurcate the
  experience at the highest level. User testing confirmed that this decision cut down
  on cognitive load because users can trust that everything in one area is public, and
  everything in another area is all private.
</p>

export const textHtml4 = `
  <p class="text-[20px] leading-relaxed text-gray-900">
  <strong>@mentions</strong> – Search and tag users in helpdesk comments so that the recipient
  can be notified.
</p>

`;

export const textHtml5 = `
<p class="text-[20px] leading-relaxed text-gray-900 mb-10">
  <strong>Live Editing</strong> – Some user pain we uncovered was that there was no visibility into
  what agent(s) were working on a specific ticket. This often led to agents
  unknowingly editing a ticket at the same time, and that experience was confusing
  and frustrating if their work was undone or not saved.
</p>

<p class="text-[20px] leading-relaxed text-gray-900">
  I designed options for how we might show user attribution during live editing of
  fields and situations where someone is actively typing in the message composer.
</p>

export const textHtml6 = `
<p class="text-[20px] leading-relaxed text-gray-900 mb-10">
  <strong>Reorder and Rename Custom Views</strong> <br/> As we interviewed helpdesk support agents we kept hearing a similar theme. In addition to the default filtered ticket views provided, agents wanted to create their own custom filtered views and be able to save the views.
</p>

<p class="text-[20px] leading-relaxed text-gray-900">
 Not having to reconfigure special views several times a day gave a lot of time back to support agents.
